# DeckGameApi
Sample project for coding challenge

The features presented are by no means exhaustive and were adjusted to time constraints.

The project was made following clean architecture pattern and single responsability principles in order to be scalable, maintenable and easily understandable.

The DB is stored in memory to expedite development, testing and ease to reproduce. Some shortcuts were taken in order to showcase more important decisions like architecture and logic.

Every route and action can be tested through the swagger API by compiling the project in http or https mode.

Unit tests were added as en exemple and are not pursuing 100% code coverage, again due to time constraints of the homework.
